A little web site wrapper so you can customize the iOS home screen icon to your liking.

Clone the repo,  
Update index.html with a site title,  
Update index.html with a site url in the iframe,  
Create your own icon.png (probably at least 128x128),  
Host wherever,  
Open in Safari on iOS,  
Arrow > Add to Home Screen,  
Enjoy
